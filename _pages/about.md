I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, computational photography and robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) of BLV Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. Boxin Shi](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

You can find my info here: [paper](../assets/2025_ruledCutting.pdf) and [images](../assets/pic.png).

**Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Master's degree starting from Fall 2024.**
